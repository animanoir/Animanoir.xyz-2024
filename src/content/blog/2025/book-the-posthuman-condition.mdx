I recently finished reading the book **The Posthuman Condition**, written by **Robert Pepperell** in 2003. In it, he explains his well-researched ideas on what a "posthumanist" society could be and why we should strive to achieve it.

The book's main thesis is the advancement of human society from the human primacy advocated by humanist philosophies to one where the "essences" of humans, animals, and machines dissolve into one continuous existence. It's important to clarify that, since language is not at all objective, there are many definitions of "humanism," many of them tending toward "goodness." I think the humanism that Pepperell tries to surpass is the one that conveys an artificial "human supremacy" over everything in existence.

He starts from a mathematical basis, explaining how reality has never really been chaotic or ordered, since these notions (good, bad, ordered, chaotic, etc.) are obviously human constructs. He is not saying that these conventions are not useful, but he encourages us to try to imagine new conceptions of reality that accept the inherent flow of nature, citing, for example, the [Lorenz Attractor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjP90rwpBwU):

One thing that Pepperell highlights is that the posthuman society has been envisioned since the time of the Greeks, particularly Heraclitus. However, it is mainly because of the advancements in computer technology that we can begin to empirically "uncover" the true interconnected nature of existence.

It's important to note that this book doesn't technically explain how a machine could gain consciousness, but it does theoretically explain how it could (like water boiling under the appropriate conditions) and considers the implications. Instead of rendering us humans obsolete, as the current narrative makes us believe, it simply wants us to expand our perspective.

What I took away most from it was this idea of "going beyond" humanist assumptions, such as giving primacy to our species over others. I must warn that there are many definitions of what "humanism" can be, so I'll just talk about the one this book portrays and tries to overcome.
