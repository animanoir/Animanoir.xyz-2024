I've just recently finished reading the book **The Posthuman Condition** written by **Robert Pepperell** in 2003 which explains,
in his own & well researched ideas, what a "posthumanist" society can be achieved and why we should do it.

The main thesis of the book is to **advance human society from human primacy advocated by humanist philosophies into one where the "essences" of humans, animals, machines, etc., dissolve into one continous existance**. It's important to clarify that, since language is not objective at all, there are many definitions of "humanism", many of them tending to "goodness". I think the humanism that Pepperell tries to surpass is the one that conveys
(artificial) "human supremacy" over everything in existance.


Starts off from mathematical bases, explaining how reality has _never really been_ chaotic nor ordered, since this notions (good, bad, ordered, chaotic, etc.) are obvious human constructs. He's not saying that this conventions are not useful, but to try to imagine new conceptions of reality that accepts the inherent _flow_ of nature, citing, for example, the [Lorenz Attractor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjP90rwpBwU):

One thing that Pepperell highlights is that the posthuman society has been envisioned since the Greeks, particularly Heraclitus,
but mainly because of the advancments of computer technology we could start to empirically "uncover" the true interconnected
nature of existence.


It's important to note that this book doesn't technically explains how a machine could gain consciusness, but theoretically explains how to (like water _boiling_ witht the appropate conditions) and thinks the implications of it, and instead of rendering us, humans, obsoletes, as the current narrative makes us believe, it simply wants us to.

What I took the most from it was this idea of "going beyond" humanist assumptions such as giving primacy to our species
over others. I must warn that there are many definitions of what "humanism" can be, so I'll just talk about the one this
book portrays and tries to overcome.
