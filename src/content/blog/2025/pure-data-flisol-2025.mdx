So there's this festival to celebrate **libre software** (not really "free" since it surpasses economic assumptions) throughout all Latin America called **FLISoL** (Festival Latinoamericano de Instalación de Software Libre). In Querétaro, México we celebrated it at the **Museo de la Ciudad**.

To contribute to this beautiful endeavor, I volunteered to teach the programming language [**Pure Data**](https://puredata.info/), which, for those who don't know it, is a **dataflow** paradigm language that kind of simulates modular synths so audio signals (DSP) flow through effects & modulations you design to create out of this world sounds & music (think Autechre or Aphex Twin).

I really enjoyed teaching both the technicalities and philosophy of using libre software, and it seems my students enjoyed learning it too. At the end, there was a cool cyberpunk, Lain-themed party, just how I like it.
