As I read more from Deleuze et al., I'm starting to merge it with what I read about the Posthuman condition. Of course, there are many definitions of what "post-humanism" really means.

I'm liking the idea of thinking in pre-human terms—pre-structures of language and thought—more in accordance with how "reality" truly is, which is far more complex than mere representations of "order" and "disorder" (fractals, strange attractors, etc.). This means considering the forces that shape these contingent notions. I'm liking the terms "continuous" and "discontinuous," which are promoted in "The Posthuman Condition" and mirror Deleuzean terms like rhizomatic, lines of flight, deterritorialization, etc.

That's why, personally, I'm starting to find the notions of "left" and "right" politics primitive, and I think there has to be something beyond them.

This relates to what my pals and I discuss, but from the game of "who's right, who's wrong," which in the end renders no conclusion whatsoever, apart from everyone defending their own egos and identities since nobody really knows what they are talking about. Can we just accept that reality has gradients and start thinking inside that spectrum?
