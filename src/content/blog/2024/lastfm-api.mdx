### I need  music.

In fact, I think it was my first platonic love, in the sense that I wanted so much to hear the most precious combination of sounds, knowing that it might not exist—ethereal being. **And that's a good thing!**

<Picture

That's the reason I constantly have music playing from anywhere. I do have a vast digital collection of music on this [channel in Are.na](https://www.are.na/tilde-colon-pipe-degrees-degrees-bullet-period-pipe-colon-tilde/dimensions-in-music-sounds) to archive the music I find & love. But sometimes, in fact most of the time, I'm unable to _catch_ the music I'm hearing at the moment, and it makes me feel as if I just lost the sight (in this case, the sound) of a shooting star...

That's why I decided to open a Last.fm account, back in 2011. I wanted to keep track of the music I was listening to and by "scrobbling" the music I could have a record of it available for me and whoever finds my profile. After that, I started to use the Last.fm API to fetch the music I was listening to and display it on this webplace.

<LastFm showAlbumCover={false} customStyle={{
  fontSize: "3rem",
  width: "auto",
  left: "0"
}} client:load/>

Cute! Doesn't it? The lil' animated bars do the trick! The above version is a simplified version of the component, configured via `props`, like to show or not show the album cover (if you hover on the text in the component under my name, you'll see the album cover).

<Picture
  src={img2}
  alt={"Took this photo when Nadja came to my city."}
  width={1280}
  height={720}
  formats={["webp"]}
  decoding="async"
  loading="lazy"
  class="blog-image"
/>

So I only wanted to explain how I do this—probably in the future I'll do more creative stuff with it :).
