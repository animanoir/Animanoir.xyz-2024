<h3 style="padding: 3rem;font-weight:bold;">I've worked extensively with multiple tools to create music and sound experiments, mostly Max/MSP, either for art installations, film, or personal enjoyment.</h3>

Please, feel free to check out some of my live improvisations inside this [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNgUiXAsdpaVd551zesL9EAmaeHKFljxM) and also in my [SoundCloud profile](https://soundcloud.com/geos_mina). **But**, as of lately, I've been uploading my stuff to [my Are.na channel](https://www.are.na/tilde-colon-pipe-degrees-degrees-bullet-period-pipe-colon-tilde/geosmina-music-sound-experiments-finished-spontaneous-or-in-process).
