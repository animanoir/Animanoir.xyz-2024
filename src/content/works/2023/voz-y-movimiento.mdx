> When you speak, you change the universe. This work makes it easier to appreciate that. Words are like stepping stones that we build one on top of the other—the basis of what we say now are the roots of our future... Fractal, recursive—being infinite, where do you want to start?

**Voz y Movimiento** is an **interactive installation** engineered to exemplify the impact of **mutual vocal expression**. Utilizing **Max/MSP** as its programming framework, the installation is calibrated to respond to vocal amplitude, thereby revealing a pre-recorded, personalized auditory message. It should be noted that the continuous playback of this message is contingent upon maintaining a consistent level of vocal engagement.

The piece was commissioned by the [Municipal Gallery of Querétaro](https://www.instagram.com/galeria.municipal/) with the theme **Génesis**, also known as _origin, beginning, inception, commencement, creation, and birth_. The exhibit was opened in October 12, 2023 along with more talented local and international artists.

The underlying principle is that vocal contributions from each individual—be it you, me, or any participant—serve as a catalyst for **mutual expression**, thereby engendering novel perspectives on existence that propel us forward. As such, it becomes incumbent upon us to provide collective reinforcement to ensure the sustained presence of these emergent realms of understanding.
