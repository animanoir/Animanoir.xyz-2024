In a synergistic collaboration with **Emmanuel Martínez** of Maremoto.mx and OTONO Record Label, we embarked on the journey to augment the sonic landscape of Jardines, a talented Mexican artist. Our goal was to provide fans with an [**interactive 3D experience**](https://maremoto.mx/) that would serve as a visual complement to the artist's newly released album.

Utilizing the **Three.js library**, we were able to create a real-time 3D environment that users can navigate and float into the sound sources.

Despite the technical challenges, the focus remained on ensuring the highest levels of **user engagement** and **performance optimization**.

This 3D web experience stands as a testament to the power of **cross-disciplinary collaboration** and cutting-edge web technologies in creating novel ways to experience music and art.
