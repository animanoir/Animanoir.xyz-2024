I recently finished reading the book **The Posthuman Condition**, written by **Robert Pepperell** in 2003 (if you're interested to know about the other
[books I read](https://www.animanoir.xyz/books/), click there). In it, he explains his well-researched ideas on what a "posthumanist" society could be and why we should strive to achieve it.

The book's main thesis is **the advancement of human society from the human primacy advocated by humanist philosophies to one where the "essences" of humans, animals, and machines dissolve into one continuous existence** (where exactly does one starts and the other ends?), this with practical implications. Now, it is not saying that humanist philosophies are necesarilly "wrong", but probably antiquate in this world that has even more knowledge about how reality might actually work.

Pepperrel clarifies what he means with _post-human_:

- Reaching _after-humanism philosophies_, not necessarilly something _different (post)_ than the human.

## Consciusness, humans and complexity

One thing I highlight, and that excites me, is the revitalization of "philosophies"/Eastern thoughts, which, in my opinion, are closer to achieving a possible social/natural harmony between us humans and the rest of sentient beings. It seems that posthumanism precisely seeks to move away from the notion that humans are "number one," superior to everything, rulers of the universe who must conquer it all. 

Beyond whether plastic has consciousness or if the multiverse exists, thinking of "consciousness" as something fundamental (as "randomness" is said to be at quantum levels) leads me to reason about it ethically—something that Buddhism has already derived from its own logic: a respect devoid of ego among all sentient beings, the importance of interdependence between events, between people—not as discrete entities separated by name, career, or preferences, but as belonging to the same matrix that continuously influences one another, whether at low or high intensity—in other words, "an emergent, non-linear system."

It also makes me think that for a computer to have consciousness, it must have a body—what is called embodied cognition (Varela/Maturana). That is, AI must feel pain if it wants to be conscious. These somewhat primitive ideas that the brain is the CPU and the body merely a peripheral, I believe, will become obsolete. Thinking of ourselves beyond mere machines, I believe, could have positive implications.

## Science, knowledge and energy

He starts from a mathematical basis, explaining how reality has never really been chaotic or ordered, since these notions (good, bad, ordered, chaotic, etc.) are obviously human constructs. He is not saying that these conventions are not useful, but he encourages us to try to imagine new conceptions of reality that accept the inherent flow of nature, citing, for example, the [Lorenz Attractor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjP90rwpBwU):

One thing that Pepperell highlights is that the posthuman society has been envisioned since the time of the Greeks, particularly Heraclitus. However, it is mainly because of the advancements in computer technology that we can begin to empirically "uncover" the true interconnected nature of existence.

It's important to note that this book doesn't technically explain how a machine could gain consciousness, but it does theoretically explain how it could (like water boiling under the appropriate conditions) and considers the implications. Instead of rendering us humans obsolete, as the current narrative makes us believe, it simply wants us to expand our perspective.

What I took away most from it was this idea of "going beyond" humanist assumptions, such as giving primacy to our species over others. I must warn that there are many definitions of what "humanism" can be, so I'll just talk about the one this book portrays and tries to overcome.
