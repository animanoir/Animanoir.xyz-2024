**"En todos lados al final del tiempo (Everywhere at the End of Time)"** is a **video game** **in the works**, funded by **PECDA (Programa de Estímulo a la Creación y Desarrollo Artístico)** that seeks to immerse the participant in the experience of cognitive decline associated with old age, specifically conditions like Alzheimer's and dementia. 

The proposal distinguishes itself from mass-market video games by employing experimental mechanics and non-linear narratives. The goal is for the player not just to observe, but to feel and experience firsthand the complexities and challenges of these conditions. 

This will be achieved through a narrative carefully designed to be both safe and playful, allowing for an empathetic and profound exploration of a reality that affects a significant part of the population. 

This approach aims to raise awareness of the symptoms and consequences of cognitive deterioration, fostering greater understanding and sensitivity towards those who suffer from it.
