I've always believed that working for FAANG companies, such as Meta, is entirely degrading, given the blatant social, political, and psychological harm these companies inflict through their 'services.' 

We should eliminate this notion ingrained in software engineers that working for these deplorable corporations is the ultimate goal—they're essentially digital masons building weapons of human destruction. 

I know Elon Musk was once revered as a saint in computer science departments, both public and private—now, shouldn't they feel ashamed for having ever praised such a clown?
